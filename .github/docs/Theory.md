# Theory Questions

## 1. What Is Python ?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Python is widely used in various domains such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation.

## 2. What Is High Level Language ? Why Is Python a High-Level Language ?

High-level languages are programming languages that are designed to be easy for humans to read and write.

Python is a high-level programming language because it is easy to read and write. It lets you focus on solving problems instead of worrying about hardware details or memory management.

## 3. What Is Interpreted Language ? Why Python Is Interpreted Language ?

An interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most of the instructions are executed directly, without the need for a compiler to convert the code into machine-level instructions.

It executes code line by line at runtime, which allows for more flexibility and easier debugging.

Python is considered an interpreted language because Python code is executed line by line by the

Python interpreter, which means you can run Python code without the need for a separate compilation step.

## 4. Why We Use Python Over C / C++ / Java ?

Python is often preferred over C, C++, or Java for several reasons:

1. Python has a simpler and more readable syntax, which makes it easier to learn and write code quickly.

2. Python has a large standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries, which allows for rapid development and prototyping.

3. Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare variable types explicitly, making it more flexible.

4. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

5. Python has a strong community and extensive documentation, making it easier to find help and resources.

6. Python is cross-platform, meaning it can run on various operating systems without modification.
